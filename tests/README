# Tests

## How to run

1. Run `npm install`.
2. Setup a test node. You can do it using `docker-compose up -d` in parent directory.
3. Configure tests with env variables or by editing [configuration file](src/config.ts).
4. Run `npm run test`.

## Don't run on the same node twice

Some tests fail when ran on the same blockchain node twice. Either always use a new node or purge the existing one with `nft purge-chain --dev`. There is also [a script](../purge-running-node.sh) to purge and restart a node, started with docker-compose.

# Builders Program Walk-Through

This document walks through current state of Uniquch Chain as of end of October 2020.

## Unique Chain Source code

Unique chain is a substrate based chain, which mainly consists of NFT pallet (developed by Unique Network) and Smart Contracts pallet.

As of now, it is based off Substrate 2.0 release and supports Ink! 3.0 smart contracts.

### Unique TestNet

The TestNet public node is avaiable at wss://unique.usetech.com. It connects to the standard AppsUI (works best with our version of AppsUI, see below, but connection can be still tested with Polkadot.js.org):

1. Open the [Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#)
2. Click on the network icon in the top left corner
3. Scroll down the list and input `wss://unique.usetech.com` under "custom endpoint"
4. After connection is established, copy these [UI Custom Types](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain#ui-custom-types) and paste them in [Developer Settings](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings/developer). Hit "Save" button.
5. Now the NFT node is connected with AppsUI. 
6. Go to [Chain State](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/chainstate) and verify that NFT pallet is visible and you can read information from it.
7. For example, select nft -> collection, and enter collection ID 4 (for SubstraPunks) and click "+" button. You will see the collection properties such as UTF-16 encoded collection name and description, UTF-8 encoded token prefix, the size of custom data, etc.

#### Getting some Unique Tokens

1. Install Polkadot{.js} extension if you don't have it already installed. Here are the links for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/polkadot%7Bjs%7D-extension/mopnmbcafieddcagagdcbnhejhlodfdd) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-extension/) extensions.
2. Create an address
3. Use Unique Faucet Telegram bot: @UniqueFaucetBot

### Smart Contracts Pallet

1. Open [Contracts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/contracts) tab. It only appears in the UI when Smart Contracts pallet is included in the runtime.
2. Additionally, we can find an existing smart contract. Click on "Add an existing contract" link.
3. Input this contract address: `5GdNqKMv4Sszq3SRd3TkXNa6a9ct4D3nXvtTWTFR7rTyccVJ`
4. Input any contract name, for example `Claim Substrapunks`
5. Download and drag-and-drop this [metadata.json](https://github.com/usetech-llc/substrapunks/releases/download/v1.0.2/metadata.json) file into contract ABI field.
6. Click Save. The contract appears in the page. If the contract did not exist at that address, the UI would display an error message: "Unable to find deployed contract code at the specified address".

### Integration Between Smart Contracts and NFT Pallet

#### TestNet

This is one of the most technically challenging parts. The pre-RC4 versions of Substrate did not function properly when we tried to use `ext_dispatch_call` to dispatch a runtime call to NFT pallet from Contracts pallet, and RC4 had the `ext_dispatch_call` already removed to "free space" for some friendlier way of interaction between pallets, that was not yet implemented. Thanks to Alexander Thei√üen who reverted the removal of `ext_dispatch_call` and created a special branch based on RC4 for us!

The smart contract source code exists in this [repository folder](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/tree/master/smart_contract/ink-types-node-runtime), but the best way to test how the interaction between smart contracts and NFT pallet works is to see it in action using the [SubstraPunks Game Example](https://ipfs-gateway.usetech.com/ipns/QmaMtDqE9nhMX9RQLTpaCboqg7bqkb6Gi67iCKMe8NDpCE/) that uses smart contract to claim free characters. The complete demo of this game will come later, so please bare with us and let's put this item demonstration for a bit later.

#### MainNet

The Ink! 3.0 Chain Extensions will allow calling pallets from smart contracts with env() object in Ink!, as soon as they are ready. Our code is prewired for this and waiting for Chain Extensions to release.

### Fungibility and Re-Fungibility support

Fungible and Re-Fungible modes are fully implemented and ready for QA as of now. Fungible mode allows creation of ERC-20-like tokens, and Re-Fungible allows sharing NFT tokens between multiple addresses.

#### Re-Fungibility

Re-fungible feature is best demonstrated in action using our NFT wallet. First, you need to have some Unique and Re-Fungible tokens. [This section](#getting-some-unique-tokens) tells how to get them.

1. Open the [NFT Wallet](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/nft)
2. Search for collection called "Artwork". Search can be done either by collection name or collection ID (which is 2).
3. Click on "+ Add collection" in search results. The collection will appear under "My collections"
4. Expand the "Artwork" collection and see that you own a token with a partial balance
5. Transfer the token to some other address: Click "Transfer token" and enter address and the amount. Amount should be entered as decimal fraction. For example "0.01" to transfer 1/100th part of the token. 
6. Observe that your balance decreased by the amount you entered.

#### Fungibility

Fungible tokens can be created manually by calling extrinsics:
1. Open [Extrinsics page in UI](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/extrinsics)
2. Select nft - createCollection
3. In the CollectionMode select Fungible, enter decimal points number and click "Submit Transaction"
4. Switch to [Explorer](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/explorer) and find the block where the transaction was mined.
5. Find nft.Created Event, which will contain the ID of the Fungible token you just created
6. In order to mint a token, use nft - createItem extrinsic. Enter the collection ID (that you found in the previous step) and submit transaction. One token will be minted. (We also support Batch minting for minting different amounts, etc).

#### Re-fungibility The Hard Way

Also, the Re-Fungible support can be demonstrated using the standard UI features without NFT wallet.

1. Open [Chain State](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/chainstate).
2. Select "nft" - "reFungbleItemList"
3. Enter parameters: 2 and 1, click "+" button
4. Observe the following data structure returned:

```
{
  Collection: 2,
  Owner: [
    {
      owner: 5FNujvbtMyKoJC2zTrfGVaQek7jhfR1L558BMhogfFfD7veH,
      fraction: 3,000
    },
    {
      owner: 5D73wtH5pqN99auP4b6KQRQAbketaSj4StkBJxACPBUAUdiq,
      fraction: 3,000
    },
    {
      owner: 5FZeTmbZQZsJcyEevjGVK1HHkcKfWBYxWpbgEffQ2M1SqAnP,
      fraction: 2,000
    },
    {
      owner: 5EnzEXBuxFHdymceAAtstym8FETQqH4inx29XJSP6uHaCUiP,
      fraction: 1,000
    },
    {
      owner: 5GU6iHnc3qTMaufmKYzHUpDmVN2CgzA2JMcGFQLcKNDbE7c6,
      fraction: 1,000
    }
  ],
  Data: 
}
```

The Owner field contains a list of owners with the fractions they own. The fractions are represented as fixed point decimals. The number of decimal points in this fraction is determined by collection properties. For example, in the Artwork collection this property is equal to 4. The owned fraction is then determined as `fraction` divided by 10^DecimalPoints, i.e. 10,000 in this case.

5. Staying in Chain State, select "nft" - "colection"
6. Input "2" and click "+"
7. Observe the following structure returned. It tells that collection is ReFungible and DecimalPoints field is equal to 4.

```
{
  Owner: 5FNujvbtMyKoJC2zTrfGVaQek7jhfR1L558BMhogfFfD7veH,
  Mode: {
    ReFungible: [
      0,
      4
    ]
  },
  Access: 0,
  DecimalPoints: 4,
  Name: [
...
```

### Off-Chain Schema to store token image URLs

This feature is best demonstrated in action using our NFT wallet. First, you need to have some Unique and Re-Fungible tokens. [This section](#getting-some-unique-tokens) tells how to get them.

1. Open the [NFT Wallet](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/nft)
2. Search for collection called "Artwork". Search can be done either by collection name or collection ID (which is 2).
3. Expand "Artwork" collection
4. Click on the image to zoom in. 
5. Right-click on the image and select "Open Image in New Tab"
6. Note the image URL:
```
https://ipfs-gateway.usetech.com/ipfs/QmUSv64cUmL2m44QYkUFWmH89qykC8VLPFwjhpeAScjejS/image1.jpg
``` 
7. Open [Chain State](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/chainstate).
8. Select "nft" - "colection"
9. Input "2" and click "+"
10. Scroll down:
```
  ],
  TokenPrefix: ARTu0000,
  CustomDataSize: 0,
  OffchainSchema: https://ipfs-gateway.usetech.com/ipfs/QmUSv64cUmL2m44QYkUFWmH89qykC8VLPFwjhpeAScjejS/image{id}.jpg,
  Sponsor: 5C4hrfjw9DjXZTzV3MwzrrAr9P1MJhSrvWGWqi1eSuyUpnhM,
  UnconfirmedSponsor: 5C4hrfjw9DjXZTzV3MwzrrAr9P1MJhSrvWGWqi1eSuyUpnhM
}
```
11. Observe the field called `OffchainSchema`. This field defines the URL schema that is used to contruct token URLs based on the token ID. In this particular example, the {id} template variable is replaced with token id 1, which results in the proper image URL.

### New economic models

This feature is best demonstrated when you own a SubstraPunk character. Please proceed with the demonstration, and then come back after you claim one.

1. Create a new address in Polkadot{.js} extension. We need an address that has zero balance in Unique tokens. Let's call it "ZERO BALANCE" address.
2. Open the [NFT Wallet](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/nft)
3. Search for collection called "SubstraPunks" (partial search also works, so you can just type "punk" and hit Enter)
4. Add collection
5. Expand substrapunks collection and transfer your PNK token to your "ZERO BALANCE" address.
6. Now select your "ZERO BALANCE" address in the drop-down list and repeat searching and adding the collection for this address.
7. Transfer token back to your main address. Observe that despite the zero balance, the transfer is successful.

### White Lists and Public Mint Permission

We did not complete these features in time by Hackusama deadline, but because they are important for security of the network, we completed them after the deadline anyway. They can be seen in branch [feature/white_list](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/tree/feature/white_list). Here are the permalinks to essential functions:

[white_lists](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/blob/b7c59f0085ed2bc1922e937adf68ef4174a8ba36/pallets/nft/src/lib.rs#L659)

[mint_permission](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/blob/b7c59f0085ed2bc1922e937adf68ef4174a8ba36/pallets/nft/src/lib.rs#L373)

## NFT Wallet

[Project Description](https://github.com/usetech-llc/apps/blob/master/README.md)

All features of the NFT Wallet were already demonstrated previously:

* Enables adding favorite collections
* Shows tokens owned
* Allows NFT and Re-Fungible transfers
* Shows Re-Fungible Balances
* Shows Token Images

## Our version of AppsUI

The UI was also mainly demonstrated. We only need to show some configuration that happens behind the scenes:

### Loads appropriate custom API types
1. Open the [NFT Wallet Developer Settings](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/#/settings/developer)
2. Observe that Custom UI types are already in place

### Defaults to NFT TestNet

1. Open the [NFT Wallet](https://uniqueapps.usetech.com/)
2. Observe that Unique Network icon appears in the left top corner without a need to specify the network
3. Click on Unique Network icon and see that `NFT Testnet` is in the network list

## Unity API and SDK PoC

[Project Description](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_unity/blob/master/README.md)

In order to see Unity Asset in action, please follow the instructions in this README file:

[Demonstration](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_unity/blob/master/src/DemoApplication/readme.md)

## SubstraPunks Game and Marketplace

[Project Description](https://github.com/usetech-llc/substrapunks/blob/master/README.md)

First, you will need some Unique balance. [This section](#getting-some-unique-tokens) tells how to get the TestNet currency.

This game initially was meant as a demonstration, but all Punks were quickly claimed, and we had to develop the marketplace to keep demonstrating capability of it. [Here](https://github.com/usetech-llc/nft_parachain/blob/master/doc/hackusama_walk_through.md#substrapunks-game) is the original description.

Here is how one can test Marketplace:

1. Open [Substrapunks Marketplace](https://ipfs-gateway.usetech.com/ipns/QmaMtDqE9nhMX9RQLTpaCboqg7bqkb6Gi67iCKMe8NDpCE/)
2. Contact us in [Unique Telegram channel](https://t.me/Uniquechain), so we can place a test NFT for you buy on the marketplace.
3. Refresh the marketplace page and click on the NFT to buy (the one we placed)
4. Go through buying process
5. Let us know to exchange KSM back for the NFT (if you would not like to keep the punk of course :) )

### How Marketplace works

Marketplace is a PoC and it consists a PoC bridge between Kusama and Unique and a Matcher smart contract.

#### Kusama Bridge

The bridge works mainly as an escrow that locks NFTs and KSM allowing users to trustlessly exchange their assets.

#### Matcher Smart Contract

The matcher smart contract allows placing punks on sale and buying. It operates assets that are locked in the bridge and releases them once the trade happens or the offer is cancelled.
